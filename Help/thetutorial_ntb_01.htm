				<td width="100%"><b>Introduction</b><p>This tutorial will guide 
				you through the complete process of creating working menus from 
				scratch.<br>
				If you would like to see how the menus, the menu bar and the 
				project will look like at the end,&nbsp; download the <a href="tutorial.zip">ZIP file</a> containing everything mentioned 
				on this tutorial.</p>
				<p><b>Creating the menu bar</b></p>
				<p>There are many ways you can create a menu bar.<br>
				The easiest and most recommended is to create a set of images 
				to serve as hotspots and place them inside the cells of a 
				table. Although you could use text instead of images, the use 
				of images is highly recommended. Also, it is<i> very important</i> 
                that you create independent images for each one of your 
                hotspots, instead of creating a single image and then using an 
                image map to define hotspots; the HotSpots Editor (a tool you 
                will learn to use in this tutorial) does not support image maps.</p>
				<p>You can use any graphic application to create your hotspot 
				images. Some sample images are provided here for you to use with 
				this tutorial:</p>
				<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="3" style="border-collapse: collapse" id="AutoNumber1" bgcolor="#000080">
					<tr>
						<td width="25%" align="center">
						<img border="0" src="tutorial/images/home.jpg" width="100" height="30"></td>
						<td width="25%" align="center">
						<img border="0" src="tutorial/images/products.jpg" width="100" height="30"></td>
						<td width="25%" align="center">
						<img border="0" src="tutorial/images/links.jpg" width="100" height="30"></td>
						<td width="25%" align="center">
						<img border="0" src="tutorial/images/contact_us.jpg" width="100" height="30"></td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>To save the above images, just right click on the image and choose <font face="Courier">Save Picture As...</font> from the 
				context menu.</p>
				<p>Open your preferred HTML editing application and create a 
				table with 4 cells in it. Since you will be using images, you 
				can choose any type of alignment for the table and its cells. Then place one image inside each cell.<br>
                When using images as the hotspots, the menus created with DHTML 
                Menu Builder will be able to auto-align to the images 
                dynamically regardless of the size of the browser or the screen 
                resolution. This is why it is so important the use images 
                instead of text-based hotspots.</p>
				<p>Now you must prepare these images so they are ready to accept 
				the menus. Only those images that will display menus need to be 
				prepared. In this tutorial we'll create two menus, one for the 
				Products hotspot and another for the Links hotspot.</p>
				<p>The first step is to convert the images into hyperlinks. Each HTML 
				editing application has its own way to create a hyperlink, so you 
				should consult your program's documentation to see how to do 
				this. When you're asked for the target link to which the 
				hyperlink should (the pound or hash sign, typically found above the number 3 on the keyboard) point to, type: <font face="Courier">#
				</font>(the pound or hash sign, typically found above the number 3 on the keyboard)<font face="Courier">.<br>
				</font>The pound symbol (#) means that this hyperlink will point 
				to itself. This is known as a &quot;null-hyperlink.&quot;<br>
				(If you want to do this by hand,  enclose the image's 
				code in &lt;a&gt; &lt;/a&gt; tags:</p>
				<blockquote>
					<p>The source code of the just the Products image should look 
					something like this:<br>
					<font face="Courier">&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;products.jpg&quot; 
					width=&quot;100&quot; height=&quot;30&quot;&gt;</font></p>
					<p>After conversion into a null hyperlink, it will look something like this:<font face="Courier"><br>
					&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;products.jpg&quot; width=&quot;100&quot; 
					height=&quot;30&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</font></p>
				</blockquote>
				<p>This is all you need to do to prepare the images that will be 
				used as hotspots.</p>
				<p>Create a folder on your hard drive 
				and call it <font face="Courier">DMB_Tutorial. (</font>For example,&nbsp; <font face="Courier">
                &quot;c:\DMB_Tutorial\&quot;)&nbsp; </font> Then create 
                an empty HTML file in that folder and name it <font face="Courier">hotspots.htm</font>.
                Later in the tutorial you will see how we will use this file as 
                the receiver for the menus.</p>
				<p>Now, create a folder called <font face="Courier">menus </font>inside the <font face="Courier">c:\DMB_Tutorial\ </font> folder. 
                We will use this folder to store the JavaScript file generated 
                by DHTML Menu Builder.</p>
				<p>Finally, create a folder called <font face="Courier">images </font>&nbsp;inside the <font face="Courier">c:\DMB_Tutorial\ </font> folder. 
                We will use this folder to store any images you menus may use.</p>
				<p>Your folder structure should look similar to the image below.</p>
