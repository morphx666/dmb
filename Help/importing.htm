            One of the most significant improvements in DHTML Menu Builder 
			Version 3.0 is the ability to generate paths that work under any 
			scenario in which they are implemented. This can be done by virtue 
			of the new
			<a style="color: blue; text-underline: single" href="configurations.htm">
			Configurations</a> section under Project Properties.<p>All of the 
			information about the items in your project is strongly tied to the 
			selected default configuration. If you are going to use a project from an older version (2.8 or older) of DHTML Menu Builder with a version 3.0 or newer, you must create this information contained in the default configuration.</p>
			<p>When
            importing a project created with an older version of DHTML
            Menu Builder, the following three&nbsp;things will be done automatically:
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Fix Groups&nbsp; Over action</b><br>
                Version 2 Groups had just one action: <i>Display the Group. </i>Version 3 Groups, on the other hand, can have multiple actions.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Fix Commands URL</b><br>
                Under earlier versions of DHTML Menu Builder, URLs could be root-level links or relative links.
                Under DHTML Menu Builder 3.0, all of the command links must be 
				fully qualified URLs. The program 
				will try to add the fully qualified path to each page based on 
				the imported information about your server's root folder.<br>
				You should check <i>each and every</i> link after you import a project. 
				Those &nbsp;links found to be faulty can be fixed by clicking on the 
				browse button under the selected action and then re-selecting 
				the target document.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>Create a default configuration</b><br>
                The single configuration that existed under earlier versions will 
				be imported as the default local configuration under DHTML Menu 
				Builder 3.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><i>After importing an older project, you must check the settings of 
			the default configuration to ensure that the setup is correct.</i></p>
            <p>Here are more issues you should check if your projects use any of 
			the features mentioned below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p><b>Opening links in new windows<br>
                </b>If your project used JavaScript commands to open a link in a 
				new window, it is recommended that you convert these actions and 
				use the integrated support to open new windows. To do the 
				conversion, just follow these simple steps:
                <ul type="disc">
                  <li>
                    <p>Change the action type to <font face="Courier">Open URL
                    in new window</font></li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Remove all the JavaScript code from the URL and just
                    leave the target link</li>
                  <li>
                    <p>Click  the New Window Settings button 
					<img border="0" src="images/icon_newwindow.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"> and set up your new window settings</li>
                </ul>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
              </li>
              <li>
                <p><b>AddIns<br>
				</b>None of the AddIns that were developed for previous versions 
				of DHTML Menu Builder will work in version 3. However, the following AddIns are now default behaviors, so these AddIns are no longer needed:<ul type="disc">
              <li>Auto Relative Positioning</li>
				<li>AutoClose Timer</li>
				<li>Context Menus</li>
				<li>For Images Only</li>
            </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            	<p><i>It is very important to understand that after saving an 
				imported project under DHTML Menu Builder 3, you will not be 
				able to re-open this same project under any previous version, so 
				you should always make backup copies of your projects.</i></p>
