				<li><font size="2" face="Tahoma"><b>You can not customize the

			<p><font face="Tahoma" size="1">I'm really sorry for this, but its
			the only way I had to fight piracy. Version 1.5.80 (which was beta
			3/4) was being pirated, and there were two cracks from two different
			groups available all over the Internet!<br>
			I just don't think is fair to crack a US$25.00 program! (1.0 and 1.5
			beta versions were available at US$25.00)<br>
			So don't blame me... and blame it on Syndicate and LASH.p</font></li>

		<li><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The documentation has been revised and
			updated with all the information that covers the new functions and
			options of version 1.5. I've also included a couple of sample pages
			to illustrate the implementation of the menus.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Tahoma">Many bug fixes! As usual.</font></li>
		<li><font size="2" face="Tahoma">The price has increased.<br>
			</font><font face="Tahoma" size="1">Why? Well, because the engine
			was upgraded to support Navigator.<br>
			Ok, Navigator may be a great browser, but its worst than a nightmare
			to the developers due to the huge
			limitations and the poor implementations of DHTML and CSS
			standards plus the limited document object model flexibilities.<br>
			It took me about 2 weeks to code version 1.0... and it took me near
			three months to crate an acceptable engine that was capable of
			generating Navigator compatible code... go figure!</font></li>
