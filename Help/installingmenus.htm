          DHTML Menu Builder provides a series of tools to help  you with the 
          process of installing the menus on your web site.<p>The menus 
          are stored in separate JavaScript files (with an extension of .js) 
          which are generated when you compile your project (using the 
          Tools-&gt;Compile option). After they are compiled, you have to add some special code (known as Loader Code) to your pages so that the browser can load these JavaScript files and display the menus.</p>
          <p>Starting with version 4.0, DHTML Menu Builder offers a new tool 
          called &quot;Install Menus&quot;. It is found on the 
          <font face="Courier">Tools </font>menu.</p>
          <p>The Install Menus tool is divided into two panes and three main 
          sections:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>The left pane (source files) is divided into<ul type="disc">
              <li>The directory structure of your web site</li>
              <li>The files on the selected directory or folder</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>The right pane (selected files)<ul type="disc">
              <li>The selected files that will receive the menus (the 
              list of files into which DHTML Menu Builder will copy the 
              Loader Code )</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <table border="0" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="100%" id="AutoNumber1" cellpadding="0">
            <tr>
              <td width="100%"><b>The web's directory structure section<br>
              <br>
              </b>
              <img border="0" src="images/im_folders.jpg" align="left" width="273" height="198">In 
              this section you will see the folders on your web site.<br>
              Clicking  any folder will display the list of HTML documents 
              under the selected folder.<p>This section also lets you do 
              global operations on the files under the selected folder.<br>
              For example, to remove the menus from the files under a specific 
              folder and all the folders inside it (if any) right click on the 
              desired folder and select the<font face="Courier"> Remove Menus
              </font>option.</p>
              <p>Another option would be to install the menus on all the 
              documents under the selected folder. To do this right click the 
              desired folder and select the<font face="Courier"> Install Menus
              </font>option.</p>
              <p>You may also drag and drop folders to the pane on the right.</td>

            <tr>

              This section shows the documents inside the selected folder. 
              Besides the standard information for a document such as its name, 
              size, and date of modification, this section also displays the 
              type of loader code, if any, currently installed on each file.<p>
              The loader code is a series of JavaScript 
              instructions used by the browser to locate the .js file(s) 
              containing the menus.<br>
              DHTML Menu Builder uses two different types of loader code 
              depending on various settings:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Standard:  used to load the main .js file 
                which contains the information to  display 
                the toolbar (if any). On projects that don't use DHTML Menu Builder frames support, this 
                loader code is also used to handle the menus.</li>
                <li>Frames: used to load the menus on projects with frames support.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>It is important to understand that the menus and the toolbar(s) 
              are created, displayed, and handled differently. This is why  the toolbar is stored in a separate file from 
              the menus when using frames support: separate types of loader codes are required to load 
              them both.</p>
              <p>A file containing no loader code will be displayed in black, a 
              file with the standard loader code in blue and a file with the 
              frames loader code in green. Files displayed in light gray are 
              documents that do not support any type of loader code.</p>
              <p>Just as with the folders pane, you can perform several actions 
              on the files displayed in the files pane. Right click a 
              file and select a command from the context menu or simply drag and 
              drop the file to one of the panes on the right. (Unless you have chosen Frames Support, there will only be one pane displayed on the right .)</td>

              this display will be updated.</p>
              <p>Clicking <font face="Courier New">Install</font> will result in the loader code being copied to the files displayed in

              will be loaded into these documents when viewed from a browser.</p>

              Note that if the selected file contains some loader code this

              <img border="0" src="images/im_seldocs_frames.jpg" align="left" width="222" height="230">Remember, when  frames support is enabled, DHTML Menu Builder  splits the code that it generates into two sections, generating two 
                files. Each of these sections/files must be copied into different web pages:</p>
				<blockquote>
                  <blockquote>

                  also contain the necessary information to render the toolbar.</li>
                  <li>The other section/file will contain the necessary code and 
                  information to display the menus.</li>
                </ul>

          <p><b>The Auto button</b></p>
          <p>Some times it can be difficult to determine which files should 
          receive the loader code. When the frames support is enabled, it 
          can be even more difficult to determine which files should receive 
          which loader code.</p>
          <p>To make this task as simple as possible, the<font face="Courier"> 
          Auto </font>button automates this process by analyzing the default 
          configuration, the menu items on the project, and the files on your web 
          site.
          Performing over a hundred different tests, the Auto function will 
          quickly determine which files require which loader code either 
          because they don't have any or the type they have is outdated.</p>
          <p>Although the process has been tested under many scenarios, it is <i>not</i> <i>guaranteed</i> that it will always detect the appropriate files. In some circumstances, it may even fail to provide any help at all.
          In this cases, add the files yourself. If the menus don't work, do the following:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>analyze the results</li>
            <li>fix the problem</li>
            <li>remove the loader code from the whole web site</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Repeat the operation and check the results again.</p>
          <p><b>IMPORTANT</b>: The Auto feature must not be used when the menus 
          are going to be installed on a shared document (a document 
          that is included by either your HTML authoring application or your web 
          server). For example, if you plan on installing the menus into a Dreamweaver template,  a FrontPage Shared Border, or  an SSI 
          document, then add this shared document yourself and do not use the Auto 
          feature.</p>
          <p><b>Search Engine Compatibility</b></p>
          <p>By default, the menus generated by DHTML Menu Builder are not 
          visible to search engines. This means that if the menus are the only 
          means of navigation on your web site, search engines will not be able 
          to follow the links on your menus and your web site will not be 
          properly indexed.<br>
          To resolve this problem you need to enable the &quot;<a href="dialogs/pp_globalsettings_ext.htm#SEO">Search 
          Engine Optimizations</a>&quot; option under the <font face="Courier New">
          File-&gt;Project Properties-&gt;Global Settings-&gt;Extended Features</font> 
          dialog.</p>
          <p>When this option is enabled, DHTML Menu Builder will generate a 
          plain, HTML-based, version of your menus which search engines will be 
          able to use to properly index your web site. This alternate navigation 
          will remain completely hidden from your visitors and will only become 
          active when a search engine visits your web site (or a user visits 
          your web site with javascript disabled).</p>
          <p>Note that for this option to work you must re-install the menus, as 
          described in this document.</p>
