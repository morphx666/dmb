			<li>DynAPI 1.0RC3 has been released; this version contains some 
			major improvements resulting in a much faster codebase. Also, this

			the groups&quot; option under Tools-&gt;Toolbars Editor-&gt;Appearance. (<span class="style1">Thanks 
			to C.A. for the suggestion</span>). <br>
			<br>
			Some of the improvements will also allows us to soon release a very 
			small script that will considerably facilitate the creation of 
			dynamic menus by allowing you to generate simple arrays and then 
			letting this function call the appropriate DynAPI functions to build 
			the menus.<br>
			The release of this script will be accompanied by the introduction 
			of two new samples:<ul type="disc">
				<li>One sample will provide basic information on how to build 
				dynamic menus from information on a MySQL database using
				<a href="http://www.adobe.com/products/coldfusion/">ColdFusion</a>.</li>
				<li>the other will provide the necessary code to integrate
