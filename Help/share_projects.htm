                implementing multiple navigation menus on the same page:<ol>
                  <li>By creating multiple toolbars on the same project<ul type="disc">
                    <li>Pros: Easier to maintain and implement. Can control 
                    which toolbars to display using the <a href="tb_vc.htm">
                    Visibility Condition</a>.</li>
                    <li>Cons: The compiled javascript files may become quite 
                    large. The use of the Visibility Condition requires a 
                    considerable JavaScript knowledge.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                  <li>By creating multiple projects and loading them 
                  simultaneously on the same page<ul type="disc">
                    <li>Pros: A separate JavaScript file is created for each 
                    project so secondary JavaScript files will be quite small 
                    (around ~4KB each) . Also, only the necessary JavaScript 
                    files will be loaded when needed.</li>
                    <li>Cons: Complex installation process. Complex maintenance.</li>
                  </ul>
                  </li>
                </ol>
                <p>Before you decide to use one method or the other you should 
                carefully consider the above mentioned pros and cons. The 
                results are usually the same with both approaches, so try to 
                determine which method will be more effective to meet your 
                needs.</p>
                <p><i>Note that the possibilities with DHTML Menu Builder are 
                quite endless... and sharing multiple projects is one good 
                example since you could even create a navigation system that 
                uses both methods: sharing projects from multiple projects and 
                controlling the visibility of some toolbars using the Visibility 
                Condition.</i></p>

                <p><b>Introduction</b></p>
                <p>Merging projects is the process of installing 
                menus from several projects into the same HTML document or 
                documents.<br>
                The way DHTML Menu Builder handles the use of multiple projects 
                is by working with a master project and secondary projects 
                (explained below). All the tools related to the compilation and 
                implementation of the menus have been enhanced to be able to 
                handle the use of multiple projects.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
                <p>In this small how-to you will learn the basics 
                for creating, preparing and implementing a navigation system 
                that uses two toolbars from two different projects:</p>
                <p><b>Creating the projects</b><br>
                The first step is to create the projects that you want to merge 
                together. Each project can have 
                any number of toolbars and even completely different settings 
                for their styles and special effects. However there're several 
                important rules that you must follow:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>Frames are not supported when sharing projects. So none of 
                  the project should have the Frames Support enabled.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB"></li>
                  <li>All projects must use the exact same type of configuration 
                  and their default configuration must be identical; that is, 
                  all the paths must point to the exact same location.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB"></li>
                  <li>Each project must have a completely different name for 
                  their compiled files. To change the name of the compiled files 
                  click File-&gt;Project Properties-&gt;Advanced and use a different 
                  name for each one of the projects.<br>
                  If you don't change the names of the compiled files, DHTML 
                  Menu Builder will randomly select different file names when 
                  your compile.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB"></li>
                  <li>If one or more secondary projects use toolbars, the master 
                  project must have, at least, one toolbar. If your master 
                  project does not require a toolbar then you can create an empty toolbar and then set its &quot;Visibility 
                  Condition&quot; to false to keep it hidden. To do so, click<font face="Courier New"> 
                  Menu-&gt;Add Toolbar </font>to add the toolbar to the project, 
                  then, right click the toolbar and select<font face="Courier New"> 
                  Properties</font>. Go to the<font face="Courier New"> Advanced
                  </font>tab and type this on the<font face="Courier New"> 
                  Visibility Condition </font>textbox: <font face="Courier New">
                  return false;</font><hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB"> </li>
                  <li>Only projects created with version 4.1 (and above) can be used as 
                  secondary projects.</li>
                </ul>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
                <p><b>Defining a master project</b><br>
                A master project is a project whose menus are always going to be 
                available. This project is the one that will always be included 
                into all the documents of your web site. This is the project 
                containing all the code to handle its own menus and the menus 
                from all the secondary projects.</p>
                <p>Any project can be the master project, so always try to 
                select the project  whose menus are going to be common to all 
                the sections of your web site.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
                <p><b>Defining the secondary projects</b><br>
                The secondary projects are those projects that are going to be 
                combined with the master project.</p>
                <p>To define the list of secondary projects click 
                Tools-&gt;Secondary Projects<br>
                Use the Add button to add projects and use the Delete button to 
                remove projects from the list.</p>
                <p>Press the OK button when you're done defining the list of 
                secondary projects.</p>
                <p>NOTE: Only projects created with DHTML Menu Builder 4.1 (or 
                above) can 
                be used as secondary projects.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
                <p><b>Compiling the projects</b><br>
                To generate all the .js files for the master and secondary projects 
                simply click Tools-&gt;Compile</p>
                <p>NOTE: DHTML Menu Builder will automatically save your master 
                project before starting the compilation process.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
                <p><b>Installing the Menus</b><br>
                To install the menus click Tools-&gt;Install Menus<br>
                The Secondary Projects dialog will be displayed so you can 
                select which combination of projects you want to install.<br>
                When done click OK</p>
                <p>Then you will see the usual &quot;Install Menus&quot; dialog.<br>
                Select the documents that should receive the master project plus 
                the selected secondary projects and click Install.</p>
                <p>As you may have already guessed, you can repeat this process 
                as many times as you like and each time selecting different sets 
                of secondary projects. This will allow you to install different 
                combinations of projects into different documents in your web site.<br>
