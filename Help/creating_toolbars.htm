          DHTML Menu Builder can create one or more menu bars from which the menus 
			will be triggered.<br>
			The type of menu bars created by DHTML Menu Builder can be used to 
			for  other functions in addition to displaying menus. That's why 
			they're known as toolbars.<p>A project configured to use toolbars enables many features in DHTML Menu Builder that are disabled by default.
			For example, when enabling  toolbar support, DHTML Menu Builder 
			will let you change the colors, fonts, and images just as you normally do with  commands. Notice that in each style dialog there's an 
          additional tab called &quot;Toolbar Item&quot; which refers to the properties of 
          the group's appearance when displayed on a toolbar.
          This is because DHTML Menu Builder will treat the groups 
			as commands when it creates the toolbar. A group displayed on a 
          toolbar is known as a toolbar item.</p>
			<p><b>Enabling  Toolbar support</b></p>
			<p>The toolbar items are comprised of the groups that you set up in DHTML Menu Builder. Therefore, you have to create at least some of the groups prior to setting up the toolbar. Once the groups are created (at least by filling in the captions), you can configure the toolbar.</p>
			<p>To configure DHTML Menu Builder so it creates a toolbar for you, 
			 
			click the <font face="Courier">Tools</font> menu and select
			<font face="Courier">Toolbars Editor</font>. Notice that, by default, DHTML Menu Builder will always create a Default toolbar tab. If you need more toolbars simply create them by clicking  Add Toolbar (<img border="0" src="images/icon_tbadd.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">).</p>
			<p>You can  delete a toolbar using  Delete Toolbar (<img border="0" src="images/icon_tbdel.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">) 
            and rename a toolbar clicking Rename Toolbar (<img border="0" src="images/icon_tbren.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">).<br>
            You can give your toolbars any name as this name is used only for your 
            reference and does not affect the menus in any way.</p>
			<p>Toolbars can also be created, renamed and deleted from the
            <a href="enhanced_map_view.htm">Map view</a>.<br>
            To create a new toolbar, click the<font face="Courier"> Menu </font>
            menu and select the<font face="Courier"> Add Toolbar </font>option.<br>
            To rename it or delete it use the options from the<font face="Courier"> 
            Edit </font>menu. Shortcuts that apply to groups and commands also 
            apply to the toolbar items in the Map view, so for example, you 
            could press the F2 key to rename a toolbar. Notice that the names of 
            the toolbar are just for your reference; they have no effect over 
            the generated menus.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
			<p><b>Stacking Multiple Toolbars</b></p>
			<p>The order in which the toolbars appears on the Map view 
            determines their Z order. Toolbars that are listed first have a 
            lower Z order while toolbars appearing at the end of the list have a 
            higher Z order. This useful because if you have toolbars that are 
            stacked one above the other, those with a higher Z order will appear 
            above those with a lower Z order. The Z order can be easily changes 
            by using the Up (<img border="0" src="images/icon_moveup.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">) 
            and Down (<img border="0" src="images/icon_movedown.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">) 
            buttons from the toolbar.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
			<p><b>Configuring the Toolbars</b></p>
			<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/tb_sel_groups.gif" align="left" width="355" height="135">You can select which groups 
            will be displayed in a toolbar and in 
			which order.
			To add groups to the selected toolbar click Add Group (<img border="0" src="images/icon_add_group.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">).<br>
            To remove a group from the toolbar, first select it and then click 
             
            Delete Groups (<img border="0" src="images/icon_delete.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">).</p>
			<p>When creating a toolbar that will be rendered horizontally, the 
			first group in the list will be the group in the leftmost position.<br>
			When creating a toolbar that will be rendered vertically, the 
			first group in the list will be the group in the topmost position.</p>
			<p>You can also add groups from the Map view: to add a new group to 
            a toolbar, simply select the toolbar item on the Map view (or any 
            other element that belongs to the desired toolbar) and select the<font face="Courier"> 
            Add Group </font>option from the<font face="Courier"> Menu </font>
            menu. Then you can also use the Up (<img border="0" src="images/icon_moveup.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">) 
            and Down (<img border="0" src="images/icon_movedown.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16">) 
            buttons to re-arrange your groups' order. The same applies to the 
            commands: you can move commands up and down to change their order.</p>
			<p>Both groups and commands can also be dragged and dropped. You can 
            drag &amp; drop groups between toolbars and you can drag &amp; drop commands 
            between groups. While dragging and dropping these items you can 
            control the desired results by holding a combination of keys so 
            instead of moving you the items are actually copied (cloned). For 
            more information see the <a href="enhanced_map_view.htm">Enhanced 
            Map View</a> section.</p>
			<p>Groups that have no commands can also be included in the toolbar. 
			These kinds of groups, as well as those containing commands, can be 
			used to open  pages or execute a script when clicked. This is very useful in creating groups that do not have 
			any menus but you still need them to be linked to some page.</p>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
              <p><b>Adding the Toolbar to your web site</b></p>
			<p>By default, the <a href="hotspot_editor.htm">HotSpots Editor</a> is used to place the menus on the page. However, when 
			you use the integrated toolbar support, the hotspots are created by 
			DHTML Menu Builder and there's no need to use the separate HotSpots Editor 
			unless you also want to use other elements  on your page to trigger the 
			menus.</p>
			<p>All you need to do in order to incorporate the toolbar is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>Compile your project</b>:&nbsp;To generate the 
				JavaScript files containing all the information for both your 
				menus and the toolbar.</li>
				<li><b>Install the Menus</b>:  this process adds the necessary code on your pages so when they are loaded by the 
				browser, they call and prepare (initialize) the toolbar and the 
                menus. To install the menus, click the <font face="Courier">Tools</font> 
				menu and then click <font face="Courier">Install Menus</font>.<br>

			</ul>
                <hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
              <p><b>Using the Toolbar with frames</b></p>
			<p>When you use the toolbar in a web site using frames, DHTML 
			Menu Builder will automatically display the toolbar in the 
            <a href="configurations.htm#TargetDocument">Target Document</a> and the menus 
            will be displayed on  all the documents where you have installed 
            the Frames Loader Code.</p>
