				<td width="100%">DHTML Menu Builder is optimized 
				to take advantage of the great features in Microsoft's Internet 
				Explorer 5.5 and above.<br>
				Because of Netscape Navigator 4's lack of support for standardized features, some  features in DHTML Menu Builder can't be reproduced on other browsers.<p><b>Known Style Issues</b><br>
				Below you will find a list of style settings supported by DHTML 
				Menu Builder that will not work on some browsers:</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Drop shadow and transparency effects (<a href="dialogs/group_sfx.htm">Special 
					Effects Dialog</a>)<br>
					</b>These effects use some proprietary features of Internet Explorer 5.5 and 6.0, so no other browser will be able to 
                    render them.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Raised and sunken borders effects on the commands 
					selections (<a href="dialogs/group_sfx.htm">Special Effects 
					Dialog</a>)<br>
					</b>These features are not available under Netscape 
					Navigator 4<br>
					The resulting menus will not show the effect<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Colored borders (<a href="dialogs/group_sfx.htm">Special 
					Effects Dialog</a>)<br>
					</b>These features are not available under Netscape 
					Navigator 4<br>
					The resulting menus will not show the effect<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Cursors (<a href="dialogs/group_and_command_cursor.htm">Cursor 
					Dialog</a>)</b><br>
					The support for different cursors is not available under 
					Navigator 4<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Border Colors (Group
                    <a href="dialogs/group_color.htm">Color</a> and Group <a href="dialogs/group_image.htm">Image 
					Dialog</a>)</b><br>
					Netscape
					Navigator 4 does not support different color borders in the same group.<br>
					The resulting menus will show a single colored border taken from the setting for the left corner.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Context Menus&nbsp; (<a href="dialogs/group_sfx.htm">Special 
					Effects Dialog</a>)</b><br>
					With the exception of Internet Explorer 4 and Opera, this feature is only supported on browsers running under 
					Windows .<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Fonts (<a href="dialogs/command_font.htm">Fonts 
					Dialog</a>)</b><br>
					Under Netscape Navigator 4, fonts may appear slightly smaller, 
					especially when using the Macintosh or Linux versions.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Netscape Navigator 4 specific issues<br>
				</b>Netscape Navigator 4 is a very old browser with a huge list of 
				problems. Here you will find some of the most common issues that 
				directly affect the menus created by DHTML Menu Builder.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Resizing the browser window crashes Navigator or 
					makes the menus inoperable</b><br>
					This is probably the most annoying bug in Navigator 4.<br>
					The reason this happens is outside the scope of this 
					document, but if you would like more information, including 
					possible solutions, try these links:<ul type="disc">

					</ul>
					<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
					</li>
					<li><b>Font sizes under Netscape Navigator appear smaller</b><br>
					Because of a bug in Netscape Navigator 4 that forces us not to use 
					in-line style sheet declarations, DHTML Menu Builder converts 
					font sizes from pixels to points.
					Under some font types and sizes, this may cause the fonts 
					under Navigator to appear slightly smaller than in other 
					browsers.<br>
					The cause of this problem is outside the scope of this 
					document, but if you would like more information try these 
					links:<ul type="disc">

					<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">

					<li><b>Browser crashes when loading a page with the menus</b><br>
					Under some circumstances, very old versions of Netscape Navigator 4 
					(specifically 4.05 and 4.08) will crash when loading the 
					menus.<br>
					This is usually caused by the combination of the menus' 
					scripts plus some other non-Navigator compatible code in 
					your page, including scripts generated by other programs.<br>
					You should try previewing the menus directly in Navigator. Alternatively, you might try creating a page that contains ONLY the 
					menus and the toolbar. If the browser does not crash with 
					the menus alone, then your pages contain some code that, when 
					used in conjunction with the DHTML Menu Builder menus, crashes the browser.</li>
				</ul>
				<p><b>Opera 5 and 6 specific issues</b><br>
				This excellent browser has made its way from a purely simple 
				browser to an almost perfect browser in terms of compatibility 
				with the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">W3C</a> standards.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Commands do get selected when hovering over them</b><br>
					Opera 5 still has no support for several DOM properties that 
					are required for menus highlighting. As a result only the 
					images change when you move your mouse over menu items.</li>
					<li><b>Resizing the browser window crashes Opera or 
					makes the menus inoperable<br>
                    </b>Just as Navigator 4, Opera 5 may crash or improperly 
                    render the menus after resizing the browser window.</li>
