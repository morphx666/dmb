                inside a cell where its left position can vary depending on the 
                browser's window size (Floating mode)</b><p>Although the menus could be attached 
                to almost any element in a page we recommend using an image as 
                this will ensure that this technique works under any of the 
                supported browsers.<br>
                So, in order to avoid the image from showing up on our page 
                we're going to use a transparent image; the best way to create a 
                small transparent image is to use any graphics editor and create 
                an 100% transparent GIF image. <a href="tbp_s07/blank.gif">Click 
                here to download an image that can be used for this purpose</a>.</p>
                <p>The next step is to insert the image in the cell. Here's a 
                sample piece of code that can be used to insert the image:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><font color="#003399" face="Courier New">&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; 
                  src=&quot;blank.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot;&gt;</font></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Now, we must give the image a name. It must be a unique name 
                which DHTML Menu Builder will use to reference this image. In 
                this tutorial we'll call our reference image &quot;RefImage&quot; and 
                here's the code that needs to be inserted into the &lt;img&gt; tag to 
                give our image a name:</p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p><font color="#003399" face="Courier New">&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; 
                  src=&quot;blank.gif&quot; width=&quot;1&quot; height=&quot;1&quot; name=&quot;RegImage&quot;&gt;</font></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p>Now, although you can't see it (and that's the idea) this 
                sample below already contains our image inside the dark blue 
                cell.<br>
                In this tutorial we're using an image that cannot be seen but, 
                in fact, you could use any image that already exists on your 
                HTML documents as a reference image. For example, if our HTML 
                layout would have had the logo in the upper corner of the dark 
                blue cell we could have used the logo as the reference image.</p>

                <p>
                <img border="0" src="tbp_s07/tbpos01.gif" width="402" height="292" style="margin-right:8px;margin-bottom:8px;" align="left">The 
                final step is to configure our toolbar so its position is not 
                fixed and, instead, it attaches itself to our image.<br>
                To do this we go to the<font face="Courier"> Tools-&gt;Toolbars 
                Editor-&gt;Positioning</font> dialog and set the
                <font face="Courier">Alignment</font> setting to
                the
                <font face="Courier">Attached To</font> option.</p>
                <p>
                Inside the <font face="Courier">Object Name</font> textbox we 
                type the name of the image that we want to use as a reference. 
                In this case we called our image &quot;RefImage&quot;.</p>
                <p>
                And, finally, its just a matter of recompiling the project using 
                the <font face="Courier">Tools-&gt;Compile</font> command to see 
                how our changes are working.</p>
                <p>
                Well, as expected, the toolbar is appearing &quot;near&quot; the image in the dark blue cell and it is following it (you can 
                verify this by resizing this window). But... it is not exactly 
                over the image. This is normal and it can be fixed by applying 
                some small offsets to tweak the final position of the menus.</p>
                <p>
                As you can see in the sample below the toolbar is appearing a 
                couple of pixels to the right so we'll need 
                to compensate this by applying a negative offset. A negative 
                vertical offset will move the toolbar towards the top and a 
                negative horizontal offset will move the toolbar towards the 
                left.</p>Click the Continue button below to see how we apply 
                these offsets and finalize our project.<br clear="all"><p align="center">
