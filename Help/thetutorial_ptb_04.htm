                As you can see, this is a very common design for a simple web 
                site and yet, placing the menus at the correct spot (inside the 
                dark blue cell) can be quite tricky.</p>
                <p>
                First of all we need to define the properties of our design. The 
                two most important things to consider here are:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>The layout is aligned to the left of the page (although 
                  the contents frame is of a variable width). This means that 
                  regardless of the 
                  browser window is size the dark blue cell will remain in the 
                  exact same position.</li>
                  <li>The position of the dark blue cell is constant in respect 
                  to the top and the left borders of the browser window.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Click the continue button below to look at how a simple menu 
                would look like if it was implemented in the above design 
                without changing any of the default positioning settings.<br>
                You must keep in mind that every new toolbar that you create 
                in DHTML Menu Builder will be placed, by default, horizontally 
                centered and at the top.<p>&nbsp;<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
