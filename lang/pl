Configurations of type local cannot be published onto a web server. Create a configuration of type remote and set it as the default.
Show %%LINE=378%% when creating a new project
This configuration prepares the menus to work on a web server 
Select Configuration
Changing the Default Configuration
When you change the default configuration the paths to the files created by DHTML Menu Builder change so you must remember to update the loader code on your documents.
Compiling Local Configurations
You're about to compile a configuration of type local. These type of configurations will only work on the machine where the menus are being developed.%%CRLF%%If this project is going to be published to a web server you will have to create a configuration of type remote and recompile the project.
Installing a disk-based Loader Code
Your default configuration is of type local. This means that the loader code that will get installed into your pages will be disk-based so the menus will only work on the machine where the menus are being developed.%%CRLF%%If this project is going to be published to a web server you will have to create a configuration of type remote and then, the loader code will be optimized to generate paths that work on your web server.
Changing Group's Alignment
In order for the change of alignment to take effect you will have to run the %%LINE=335%%.%%CRLF%%If you have already attached the groups to your hotspots, by simply running the %%LINE=335%% and clicking on the Install button will apply the changes.
Possible Compatibility Problems
Incomplete Configuration Setup
Some paths of your local configuration are empty. This could cause unpredictable results.%%CRLF%%In order to ensure that DHTML Menu Builder is able to properly generate a project works on your web site always fill all the parameters from all your configurations.
