				<td width="100%"><b>Scenario: When the menus appear perfectly positioned under some 
                  browsers and not others (Floating mode)</b><p align="left">The
                <a href="thetutorial_ptb_01.htm">previous tutorials</a> about 
                positioning only showed how the toolbars appeared under 
                Internet Explorer. If you try one of the samples in the 
                tutorials using 
                FireFox or any other browser you would notice that the toolbars 
                appear out of position... or do they?<p>
                <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/ff01.gif" width="456" height="365" align="left">This 
                image on the left shows how the menus look under FireFox. They 
                appear to be out of position but the fact is that its the HTML 
                content that is out of position. If you compared the position of 
                the menus under Internet Explorer and FireFox you would see that 
                they are being displayed at exactly the same spot but the HTML 
                content is actually being rendered lower under FireFox. Why? 
                Well, because on this particular sample we didn't specify a top 
                margin for the BODY and Internet Explorer uses a different 
                &quot;default top margin&quot; than other browsers.<p>
                Although most modern browsers try to follow the W3C standards as 
                close as possible to render HTML content there're a lot of 
                situations where one browser will interpret the standards in a 
                different way resulting in the HTML layout being rendered 
                differently.<p>
                So, how do we deal with this problem? Well, DHTML Menu Builder 
                provides what's known as custom offsets. A custom offset is a 
                highly configurable condition that, when met, will apply a 
                specific offset.<br>
                Since we designed the menus to work under Internet Explorer we 
                could create a condition that when a Mozilla-based browser is 
                detected we apply a different vertical offset so the toolbar 
                appears properly positioned.<p><br clear="all">
                Here's how this is done:<p>Click <font face="Courier">File-&gt;Project 
                Properties-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Menus Offset</font>. Click the 
                <font face="Courier">Advanced</font> button.<p>
                <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/cus_off01.gif" align="left">You will now see the 
                <font face="Courier">Custom Offsets</font> dialog. This dialog lists 
                all the custom offsets that we have defined. DHTML Menu Builder 
                supports an unlimited number of custom offsets.<p>Click the
                <font face="Courier">Add</font> button to add a new custom 
                offset.<p>The Custom Offsets dialog may look complex and 
                overwhelming but it's actually very easy to use. The dialog is 
                divided in to two main sections: the Assistant and the Advanced.<p>
                Most of the offset differences produced by the way HTML content 
                is rendered under different browsers can be resolved by using 
                the Assistant. The Assistant is the default section of the 
                Custom Offset dialog and requires no knowledge of javascript 
                programming and yet it is powerful enough to cover almost all 
                circumstances and conditions where a custom offset might be 
                needed.<p>Let's take a look at all the sections in the Custom 
                Offsets dialog to get familiarized with them:<br>
&nbsp;<hr noshade color="#D8D8D8" size="1">
                <p><b>Description</b></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                  <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/cus_off_def01.gif" align="left">In 
                this area you can type a small description for the custom 
                offset. This is very useful so you know what this custom offset 
                is used for in case you need to revise your project in the 
                future.<p>For the purposes of this tutorial we're going to write 
                this description: Fix offset for Mozilla-based browsers</blockquote>
                <hr noshade color="#D8D8D8" size="1">
                <p><b>Condition</b></p>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                  <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/cus_off_def02.gif" align="left" style="margin-right:18px">This is the section where you define the condition. The 
                condition is very important because it will determine when DHTML 
                Menu Builder will apply the offset.<p>The section is divided into three main sub-conditions:<ul>
                    <li><b>The Platform:</b> The platform defines the operating 
                  system under which the browser is being used and can have the 
                  following values:<p>- 
                  Any: The condition will be applied regardless of the operating 
                  system being used to view the menus.<br>- Windows: The condition will be applied when the browser is 
                  running under Windows.<br>- Linux: The condition will be applied when the browser is 
                  running under Linux.<br>- Mac: The condition will be applied when the browser is 
                  running under Mac.</p>
                    <p>Although most cross-platform browsers, such as Mozilla, will 
                  render the content exactly the same under any platform 
                  there're situations where the HTML layout will present some 
                  minor variations depending on the platform under which the 
                  browser is being used. This is specially true for Internet 
                  Explorer 5 for Mac.</p>
                    <p>In this tutorial we'll leave the condition as &quot;Any&quot; because 
                  we want to apply the same offset regardless of the platform 
                  being used.<br clear="all">&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><b>The Browser:</b> Here we can choose for which browser 
                  we want to apply the offset. Notice that for each browser we 
                  have three options: &quot;The browser&quot;, &quot;Not the browser&quot; and 
                  &quot;Ignore the browser&quot;.<br>This is so because DHTML Menu Builder will treat some browsers 
                  as a combination of browsers. Don't worry if you feel 
                  confused... there is a very good reason for this.<br>For example, DHTML Menu Builder will &quot;see&quot; Safari as 
                  combination of three browsers: Internet Explorer, 
                  Mozilla-based and Opera. So, if you want to apply a custom 
                  offset for Internet Explorer that doesn't affect other 
                  browsers you should setup your browser condition as seen in 
                  this image:<p>
                    <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/cus_off_def03.gif" width="396" height="101"></p>
                    <p>So why does DHTML Menu Builder sees browsers as a 
                  combination of other browsers? To simplify the code... but, 
                  don't worry too much about it. Just keep in mind that if you 
                  create a custom offset for browser A and you see the offset 
                  affecting browser B and you did not want this to happen then 
                  simply use the &quot;Not the browser&quot; option for browser B.</p>
                    <p>Here's a list of browser grouping performed by DHTML Menu 
                  Builder:<ul type="disc">
                      <li>Internet Explorer is seen as a unique browser</li>
                      <li>Netscape 4 is seen as a unique browser</li>
                      <li>Mozilla-based browsers (such as FireFox and Netscape 6 and 
                  7) are seen as a combination of Mozilla-based browsers and 
                  Internet Explorer</li>
                      <li>Opera is seen as a combination of Internet Explorer, 
                  Mozilla-based and Opera</li>
                      <li>Safari (and/or Konqueror) is seen as a combination of 
                  Internet Explorer, Mozilla-based, Opera and Safari</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Since in this tutorial we want our offset to affect all 
                  Mozilla-based browsers we are going to select the 
                  &quot;Mozilla-based&quot; option. According to the browser grouping 
                  table above, any offset applied to Mozilla-based browsers will 
                  also affect Safari and Opera. This is a good thing because the 
                  offset that you see on the screenshot at the top of this page 
                  is also occurring under these browsers so with just one custom 
                  offset we're going to solve a positioning problem under three 
                  different browsers!<br>&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><b>The Browser Version:</b> Here you can restrict the 
                  condition so it is only applied under a specific version of 
                  the selected browser. This is particularly useful to 
                  accommodate issues with very old browsers. For example, 
                  suppose
                    that you have discovered that there's an offset issue with 
                    Netscape 6, but the menus appear properly positioned under 
                    all other versions of Netscape; in this case you would 
                    select the Mozilla-based option and then set the browser 
                    version to &quot;Less than 7&quot;, which means that the condition 
                    will be applied to all Mozilla-based browsers whose version 
                    is below 7.0:<p>
                    <img border="0" src="tbp_s10/cus_off_def04.gif" width="199" height="45"></p>
                    <p>You're probably asking yourself, and why not use &quot;Equal 
                    to 6&quot;? Because using &quot;Less than 7&quot; is a more generic 
                    condition and it will let us target versions 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 
                    and so on...</p>
                    <p>For the purposes of this tutorial we're going to leave 
                    the browser version condition as &quot;Any&quot; because we want to 
                    target all browser versions.</li>
                  </ul>

                  is where you specify the offset that will be applied when the 
                  Condition that you have defined is met.<br>
                  As you can see you can specify offsets for all the elements in 
                  a project: toolbars, root level menus and submenus.</p>
                  <p>For the purposes of this tutorial we only need to specify a 
                  small vertical offset for the toolbar. Notice that we have 
                  specified 10 pixels vertically.</p>
                  <p>This means that when DHTML Menu Builder detects that the 
                  menus are being viewed by any Mozilla-based browser, the 
                  toolbar will be pushed 10 pixels down.</p>
                  <p>The result can be seen on this screenshot of the FireFox 
                  browser:</p>
