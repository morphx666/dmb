          <td width="100%">The final process of implementing a menu system with 
			DHTML Menu Builder involves the ability to save the menus in a 
			folder on your computer.<br>
            To do this, DHTML Menu Builder needs to know where to save the 
			compiled JavaScript files and the images that your menus use.<p>To access the Configurations editor click 
          <font face="Courier">File-&gt;Project 
            Properties-&gt;Configurations</font></p>
          <p>By default, when you create a new project DHTML Menu Builder will 
          create a new configuration called &quot;Default&quot;.<br>
          Bellow is a list of the settings that need to be made:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Local Path to the Root Web<br>
                </b>This is the route or path to the folder containing your main 
				HTML page. Typically, this is index.htm, default.htm,  index.html or default.asp.<br>
              Always avoid typing the path manually; use the browse button
              <img border="0" src="images/icon_open.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"> to select the folder and avoid typographical errors.</li>
              <li><b>Folder to Store Compiled Files<br>
                </b>This setting must point to a folder inside your root web 
				where you will store the JavaScript files compiled by DHTML 
				Menu Builder. These files are the scripts that build and handle 
				the menus. Again, always avoid typing the path manually and use the browse button
              <img border="0" src="images/icon_open.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"> to select the folder and avoid typographical errors.</li>
              <li><b>Folder to Store Images<br>
                </b>This path is where you want DHTML Menu Builder to store the 
				images files used by your menus. This folder must also 
				be inside your root web.<br>
              As always,&nbsp; avoid typing the path manually and use the browse button
              <img border="0" src="images/icon_open.gif" align="absmiddle" width="16" height="16"> to select the folder and avoid typographical errors.</li>
            </ul>
            <hr noshade size="1" color="#808080">
            <p>DHTML Menu Builder needs some additional information about 
			your web site and the files in it.<br>
            For example, if your site uses frames you will have to set up  frames support and specify the necessary settings related to 
			frameset structure of your web site.</p>
            <p>Another group of settings will let you use the HotSpots Editor to 
			automate the process of inserting the code necessary to run the 
			menus on your web site.</p>
            <p><b><a name="TargetDocument"></a>Setting up the document that will 
            trigger the menus</b></p>
            <p>Besides the standard path 
			settings described above, each configuration must have information about the document on your 
            web site that will be used to trigger the menus.
			The menus can be triggered from the <a href="creating_toolbars.htm">
            toolbar</a> created by DHTML Menu Builder or through the use of
            <a href="preparing_your_web_site.htm">HotSpots</a>.</p>
            <p>NOTE: This file  will be modified by DHTML Menu Builder to include all the code necessary to make the menus 
			work. It is a good practice to always keep a backup copy of this file.</p>
            <p>As you can see, DHTML Menu Builder gives you the option to 
            install the menus onto a single file. However, you may want to install the 
            menus on all the files on your web site, and there are several ways to 
            this:<br>
            Ideally you should install the menus onto a single file and then 
            share this file across all the other documents on your web site. 
             
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Some applications, such as Macromedia's Dreamweaver let you create a 
            template from which all the documents on your web site inherit their 
            style. This template is where you should install the menus so every 
            time you create a new document it will automatically inherit the 
            code that loads the menus. For more information about templates, 
            consult your Dreamweaver documentation.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>If your HTML editor does not support templates you could then use some sharing technique that is either supported by your web server or your HTML authoring application. </p>
            <ul>
              <li>For example, Microsoft's FrontPage supports something known as the Page Inclusion component. This component allows you to include a page inside another page. For more information about the Page Inclusion component, consult your FrontPage documentation.</li>
          </ul>
            <p>Finally, many web servers support SSI or Server Side Includes. To 
            know if your web server supports this feature and for information on 
            how to use it, consult your web server's documentation or ask your server 
            administrator.</p>
            <p><b>Setting up your project to support frames</b></p>
            <p>DHTML Menu Builder has 100% support for implementing the menus on 
			web sites that use frames.<br>
            A common issue when using frames is that most of the time the menus 
			will not fit on the frame where you have designed the toolbar. The 
			only solution, since it's not possible to display anything above the 
			division of two frames, is to have the menus appear on another, 
			larger frame.</p>
