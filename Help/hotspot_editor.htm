          The HotSpots Editor is a tool integrated into DHTML Menu Builder that 
			automates the process of implementing the menus in the files of your 
			web site.<p>There are two basic steps performed by the HotSpots 
			Editor:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><b>The addition of the loader code</b><br>
              The loader code is a series of JavaScript 
              instructions used by the browser to locate the .js file(s) 
              containing the menus. These 
				files contain all the information about your menus plus the code 
				necessary to make them work.<hr noshade size="1" color="#EBEBEB">
				</li>
				<li><b>The addition of the trigger code</b><br>
                The trigger code is 
						the code that is placed on your hotspots, and enabling them to respond 
						to  mouse actions and display the menus.
				Without this code, your hotspots would not be able to detect when 
				the mouse was over them.</li>
			</ul>
            <p>To access the HotSpots Editor use either of following methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>From the <font face="Courier">Tools</font> menu,
                click <font face="Courier">HotSpots Editor</font></li>
              <li>Click  the HotSpots Editor icon
				<img border="0" src="images/icon_hse.gif" align="middle" width="16" height="16">
                on the toolbar</li>
            </ul>
			<p><b>Attaching the Groups</b></p>
			<p>The process of attaching a group to a hotspot is very simple:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Select the hotspot from the list of available hotspots.</li>
				<li>Select the group you want to attach from the list of groups.</li>
				<li>Select the alignment.</li>
				<li>If the selected hotspot is an image you will be able to 
				change the image name. In order to enable support for 
				auto-alignment of the menus, the images must have a name.</li>
				<li>If the selected hotspot is text, the x,y (left and top) coordinates of where you want your menu to be displayed has to be specified.
				Since manually obtaining the best x,y position can be a tedious 
				job, you can use the <font face="Courier">Active Text</font> feature. This converts the text-based hotspot into an active 
				element that supports auto-relative positioning, just like image-based hotspots do. This means that DHTML Menu Builder 
				will be able to determine from the browser for the exact position of the 
				hotspot when the web page is loaded and and automatically align the menu to the 
				hotspot. This will occur accurately even if the position of the hotspot changes when the 
				browser window is resized.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Repeat the above steps for all your groups.</p>
			<p><b>Installing the loader code when using frames</b></p>
			<p>If your hotspots are located in one frame and your 
			menus are shown in another, each document loaded in the frame where 
			the menus are to be displayed must contain an additional loader code 
			that loads a special file created by DHTML Menu Builder.</p>
			<p>This is done using a  tool integrated into DHTML Menu 
			Builder. After you commit your changes in the HotSpots Editor, DHTML 
			Menu Builder will automatically display a dialog to let you add 
			files that need this loader code.
			You should add all the documents that will be displayed in the frame that displays the menus. After clicking the <font face="Courier">Install</font> button 
			DHTML Menu Builder will scan all the added files and add the 
			required loader code.</td>
