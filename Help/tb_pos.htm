			The alignment dialog in the Toolbars Editor is a very powerful tool 
            which lets you take complete control over the follow parameters that 
            affect the way the toolbar is positioned on the browser's window:<ul>
              <li>Anchor: This controls the fixed areas of the toolbar that will 
              remain fixed regardless of the alignment setting</li>
              <li>Alignment: This controls how the toolbar will be positioned 
              relative to the browser's window</li>
              <li>Position: And this controls where in the document the toolbar 
              will be displayed</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Being able to work with the above parameters on their own would 
            be a quite complex and tedious task; this is why DHTML Menu 
            Builder's Toolbar Positioning dialog provides a very easy to use 
            interface where all you have to do is select from an alignment mode 
            and if necessary set an offset.</p>
            <p>The alignment control is divided in three modes:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><b>Aligned and Anchored:<br>
              </b>In this mode you select the position from 9 available options. 
              Each option will automatically align and anchor the toolbar to a 
              specified location of the browser's window and maintain this 
              setting even if the browser is resized.<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="80%" id="AutoNumber1" cellpadding="2">
                <tr>
                  <td align="left" valign="top">
                  <img border="0" src="images/exal01.jpg" align="left" width="116" height="55"></td>
                  <td align="left" valign="top" width="100%">For example, in the 
                  configuration shown here the toolbar will be anchored to 
                  top/right corners of the browser's window.<br>
                  This configuration will be maintained regardless of the window 
                  size and even if this size changes after the toolbar has been 
                  displayed.<br>

              coordinate.<br>
              The coordinates are provided in pixels and as in the previous mode

                  <td align="left" valign="top" width="100%">In this sample the 
                  toolbar will be positioned at exactly 40 pixels from the left 
                  corner of the browser's window and 120 pixels from the top 
                  border.<br>

              <li><b>Attached to...:</b><br>
              Sometimes, placing the toolbar so it flows with the rest of the 
              contents of the page can be quite a difficult task.<br>
              With this positioning option you can force the toolbar to follow an 
              item in the HTML document so its position will depend on the 
              position of the &quot;attached to&quot; object (which is usually an image) 
              and the selected alignment.<br>
              Optionally you can force the image to inherit the size of the 
              toolbar, this way, whatever content appears next to the image will 
              appear to flow as if it was flowing around the toolbar. Note that 
              this option is only available when the alignment has been set to 
              Bottom/Left.<table border="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="#111111" width="80%" id="AutoNumber3" cellpadding="2">
                <tr>
                  <td align="left" valign="top">
                  <img border="0" src="images/exal03.jpg"></td>
                  <td align="left" valign="top" width="100%">In this sample the 
                  toolbar will follow an object named &quot;LeftImage&quot; and it will 
                  be aligned in a way so the toolbar will always appear below 
                  the object and centrally aligned.<br>

              <li><b>Free Flow...:</b><br>
              All the previous positioning methods will create toolbars that 
              appear floating above all the contents in a page.<br>
              In this mode, the toolbar will not float, but instead, will be 
              part of the HTML contents on the page allowing it to flow with the 
              rest of the HTML content... just as if it were an image or a table 
              or some other common HTML element.<br>
              For this mode to work you need to add an ID to some enclosing 
              element in the page. The toolbar will then look for that ID and 
              will insert the toolbar inside the tag that contains that ID.<br>
              A more detailed explanation of how this method works can be found 
              on the <a href="thetutorial_ptb_11.htm">Positioning the menus</a> 
              tutorial.<br>
&nbsp;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Finally you can further tweak the position of the toolbar by 
            specifying a custom offset. The offset is specified in pixels and 
            its applied to the position of the toolbar after it has been 
            calculated based on the selected alignment.</p>
